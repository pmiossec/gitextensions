Disabling some convenient but expensive feature could be useful when your repository has a lot of references (local branches, remote branches or tags) in it.

When lag during scrolling of revision graph due to a lot of branches
* Disable "Show revision graph column"

When refresh is slow due to a lot of branches:
 * "Show ahead and behind information on status bar in browse window" (retrieving ahead/behind could be expensive when a lot of branches)
 * Hide left panel or:
    * Hide "Branches" in left panel (building tree nodes could be expensive)
    * Hide "Remotes" in left panel (building tree nodes could be expensive)
